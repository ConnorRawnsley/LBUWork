    "1. The format has been around (literally) since the start of (electronic) Programming. We can open files written in the 1960s, because they are in this format. We can be reasonably confident that we will always be able to open plain text files.\n",
    "2. We can easily detect differences between versions of program files. Which in turn means we can store versions of the files in a _Version Control System_, like Git. More on that later."

    "\n",
    "Program files, being plain text do not work that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is important not to think of \"Python Files\". A Python program is just a plain text file, and we can open it using any one of (probably) hundreds of applications. That difference is _very important_, especially if you plan to use Microsoft Windows, which tries to hide this important distinction."
